# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in different programming languages.

## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental algorithms used to arrange elements of a list or array in a specific order, such as numerical or lexicographical order. They are essential tools in computer science and are used in a wide range of applications.

This repository aims to provide implementations of popular sorting algorithms along with explanations and examples for each algorithm.

## Algorithms Included

The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this repository:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Cocktail Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Sort Deck
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Bitonic Sort
- Shell Sort

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in one or more programming languages. To use a specific algorithm, navigate to the corresponding directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file.
